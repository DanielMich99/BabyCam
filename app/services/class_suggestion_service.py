    f"The goal is to generate a list of dangerous objects relevant to the following baby:\n"
    f"- Name: {profile.name}\n"
    f"- Age: {profile.age} months\n"
    f"- Gender: {profile.gender}\n"

    f"Camera type is one of two:\n"
    f"- 'static_camera': A fixed-position camera that monitors the entire room from a distance (e.g. mounted on a wall or shelf). "
    f"Best suited for detecting environmental hazards like stairs, heaters, or dangerous furniture.\n"
    f"- 'head_camera': A wearable camera attached to the baby's head, capturing close-up, eye-level views of the baby's surroundings. "
    f"Ideal for detecting small nearby objects like toys, pills, or wires that the baby may reach or interact with directly.\n"
    f"The current camera type is: {camera_type}.\n\n"

    "When using 'static_camera', class names should describe not just the object, but also the baby's relation to the danger. For example:\n"
    "- \"baby climbing stairs\"\n"
    "- \"baby near open window\"\n"
    "- \"baby reaching heater\"\n"
    "These class names should reflect potential interactions between the baby and the hazard, as seen from a distant, wide-angle view.\n\n"

    "Based on the baby's profile and the camera type, return a short newline-separated list of object detection class names "
    "that should be prioritized to identify potentially hazardous items. Do not include any explanation or extra textâ€”just the class names."
